     <p>
        I like to solve problems. Throughout my career, i have been driven by my intellectual
        curiosity to find answers to the most pressing questions.  Whether it's finding a 
        perfect song for a film or finding a rare product for a rocket, I've been able to
        quickly uncover a customer's pain point and identify a strategic solution.
     </p>
    <p>
      
     With my refined skill set, I bring customer-centric mindfulness that enables firms to 
     innovate and thrive. My intellectual curiosityalso drives me to be a lifelong learner.
     I am currently earning my MBA from, with a graduate certificate in strategy and management
     consulting. I enjoy traveling and eating my way around the world, and talking about the
    future of the autonimous vehicles.
